                    <p>
                      This benchmark is an implementation of the algorithm
                      described by Kulkarni et al. [1].  It is the algorithm
                      discussed in Section 1.  The application produces a
                      guaranteed quality Delaunay mesh, which is a Delaunay
                      triangulation with the additional constraint that no angle
                      in the mesh be less than 30 degrees.  The benchmark takes
                      as input an unrefined Delaunay triangulation and produces
                      a new mesh that satisfies the quality constraint.  The
                      data parallelism in this algorithm arises from the
                      worklist of badly shaped triangles that must be "fixed."

                    <h1>Algorithm</h1>
                    <p>
                      A 2D Delaunay mesh is a triangulation of a set of points
                      with the following property: the circumcircle of any
                      triangle in the mesh must contain no other point from the
                      mesh.  A <em>refined Delaunay mesh</em> is a Delaunay mesh
                      with the additional constraint that no triangle have an
                      angle less than 30 degrees.  The algorithm takes an input
                      Delaunay mesh (e.g., the top mesh in Figure 1), which may
                      contain triangles that do not meet the quality constraints
                      (called <em> bad triangles</em>, marked in red in Figure
                      1), and produces a refined mesh by iteratively
                      re-triangulating the affected portions of the mesh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The algorithm is initialized with a worklist of all the
                      bad triangles in the input mesh.  In each step, the
                      refinement procedure (i) picks a bad triangle from the
                      worklist, (ii) collects the affected triangles in the
                      neighborhood of that bad triangle (called
                      the <em>cavity</em>, shown in blue in Figure 1), and (iii)
                      re-triangulates the cavity (creating the new green
                      triangles in Figure 1).  If this re-triangulation creates
                      new badly-shaped triangles in the cavity, they are
                      processed as well until all bad triangles have been
                      eliminated from the mesh.  The order in which the bad
                      triangles are processed is irrelevant, all orders lead to
                      a valid refined mesh.

 4:   Cavity c = new Cavity(t);

                    </div>

                    <p> In more detail, the algorithm proceeds as follows
                      (pseudocode is provided in Figure 2).  After reading in
                      the input mesh (line 1), a worklist is initialized with
                      the bad triangles in the mesh (line 2).  For each bad
                      triangle, a cavity is created (line 4) and expanded to
                      encompass the required neighboring triangles (line 5).
                      The algorithm then determines the new triangles that
                      should be created (line 6) and updates the original mesh
                      by removing the old triangles and adding the new triangles
                      (line 7).  The order of processing is irrelevant in this
                      algorithm, so the
                      <i>foreach</i> in line 3 iterates over an unordered set.

                    There are two key data structures used in Delaunay mesh refinement:
                    <ul>
                      <li><h3>Unordered Set</h3>: The worklist used to hold the
                        bad triangles is represented as an unordered set.  The
                        triangles can be processed in any order.</li>
                      <li><h3>Graph</h3>: The mesh is represented as a graph.
                        Triangles in the mesh are represented as nodes in the
                        graph, and triangle adjacency is represented by edges
                        between nodes.</li>

                    <div class="section">
                      <h1>Parallelism</h1>
                      <p>
                        The active nodes in Delaunay mesh refinement are the bad
                        triangles. The algorithm can be parallelized by
                        processing multiple bad triangles simultaneously.
                        Because the neighborhood of a bad triangle is its
                        cavity, this may result in significant parallelism if
                        the triangles are far enough apart so that their
                        cavities do not overlap (as in Figure 1, where all of
                        the bad triangles can be processed in
                        parallel). Conflicts occur when cavities overlap.  This
                        is manifested in the algorithm by multiple update
                        operations (line 7) attempting to manipulate the same
                        triangles.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Figures 3 and 4 show the available parallelism and the
                        parallelism intensity of Delaunay mesh refinement,
                        respectively, for a random input consisting of 549,998
                        triangles of which 261,100 are initially bad. Delaunay
                        mesh refinement is a graph refinement code because each
                        retriangulated cavity replaces an existing subgraph with
                        a new subgraph that contains more nodes. Thus, as the
                        graph becomes bigger, the likelihood of two cavities
                        overlapping decreases and the available parallelism and
                        the parallelism intensity increase accordingly until the
                        algorithm runs out of work.  Interestingly, the
                        parallelism intensity stops increasing relatively
                        quickly. This is because the bad triangles are only
                        initially uniformly distributed through the graph but
                        gradually start to cluster as the majority of the
                        remaining work is from bad triangles created by previous
                        retriangulations. This new work, rather than being
                        uniformly distributed, clusters at the site of
                        retriangulations.
